Arduino application to play with logic circuits

This project is inspired on [Computer Engineering for Babies](https://computerengineeringforbabies.com/) book.
I was curious about how it could be implemented.

## Hardware
I'm using Arduino Nano as we don't need many resources for this project

Two buttons are the gates inputs.

For selecting the circuit (page of the book) I choose some photoresistors using them as a binary input, so with 3 ones I can
have up to 8 different pages.

## Software
For simplicity I used Arduino's language and its IDE.
A strategy pattern has been used for selecting the circuit.
